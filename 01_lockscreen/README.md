# 01: The Nintendo Switch Lock Screen

## What you might learn (if you didn't know already)
* Layouting a UI using the CSS Grid and Flexbox tools.
* Working with different audio samples using JavaScript and making them play when a user presses different keys.
* Checking for a sequence of keypresses and evaluating if it's correct or not (using Event Listeners).
* Using `setTimeout` to reset a sequence if a user stops pressing keys.
* Recreating the cool ghost image animation that happens when the screen unlocks.
